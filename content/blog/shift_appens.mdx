Last week I participated in an hackathon in my hometown, Coimbra, called [Shift Appens](https://shiftappens.com/). I teamed up with some friends, and we ended up winning! It was an incredible experience: all of my teammates were far more experienced programmers than I am, so I learned a lot by observing.
Before the event, we knew we wanted to work with React Native, so I actually spent the full week learning it to make sure I could be useful. I liked it, and will definitely build more things with it!

Here's a demo of the app:
